# Production deployment

Configured October 1, 2026 through the signed-in Chrome dashboards.

## Services and domain

- Canonical site: https://musicale.alexyoon.com
- Vercel: `yoonalexanders-projects/musicale`, Hobby plan, GitHub `yoonalexander/musicale`, production branch `main`.
- Supabase: `musicale` in `AlexYoon`, Free plan, project reference `geqddmynokawzojkteko`, region `us-east-1`.
- Supabase URL: https://geqddmynokawzojkteko.supabase.co
- Namecheap CNAME: host `musicale`, target `8498f7b1a8a3bcb5.vercel-dns-017.com.`, automatic TTL. Vercel reports Valid Configuration and the site serves HTTPS.

Vercel Production and Preview have `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. The latter contains the project's browser-safe publishable key. No service-role or privileged secret key is configured in the app. Preview currently uses the production backend; use a separate project before testing mutations in previews.

## Database and authentication

The new database was inspected first and had no public tables or migration history. Migrations `0001`–`0006` were applied in order through the SQL editor, followed by the seed. Their versions, names and original statements were recorded in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`. That schema is private, its tracking table has RLS, and public/anon/authenticated access is revoked. Do not reapply the bootstrap or reset hosted data.

Verified: six tracked migrations, twenty songs, twenty official provider links and today's UTC matchup. The ten curated starter pairs were scheduled for October 2–11 with conflict preservation; eleven matchups now cover October 1–11. The queue must be replenished through Admin before it runs out.

Supabase Auth Site URL is `https://musicale.alexyoon.com`. Its allowed redirect is exactly `https://musicale.alexyoon.com/api/auth/callback`. Email authentication and confirmation remain enabled; anonymous sign-ins remain disabled.

Custom SMTP is **not configured**. Supabase's default mail service only accepts project-team recipients and is limited to two messages per hour; it is unsuitable for public sign-in. See [Supabase SMTP documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp). Choose an email provider, verify its sending domain, and configure its SMTP credentials directly in Supabase. Do not add SMTP credentials to frontend environment variables or Git.

No production administrator has been assigned. After the owner's first successful app sign-in, identify that exact account and grant only it the admin role using a trusted SQL session.

## Verification and remaining work

The production deployment is Ready and `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ready"}`. Live Chrome checks verified the daily matchup, the twenty-song leaderboard and the enabled sign-in form, with preview mode removed. A read-only database check confirmed RLS on every public table and on migration tracking. Local tests verify magic links, voting, results, persistence, profiles, authorization and admin tools against an isolated backend.

Hosted email delivery, a real authenticated vote, persistence after reload, streak changes and owner administration remain unverified until SMTP and an owner app account are available. No synthetic accounts or votes were created in production.

Keep the editorial queue supplied, expand the catalog as desired, and use `/api/health` for a hosting monitor. No separate Render server is required by this Next.js/Supabase architecture. No paid plan or add-on was enabled during this setup.
